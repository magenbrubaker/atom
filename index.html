    <title>A Local's Guide to Jupiter, Florida</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Home to many professional golfers and retirees, Jupiter, Florida is a small beach town just north of West Palm Beach. Getting off I-95 onto Indiantown Road --- Jupiter may not seem to be anything special, but once you reach the beach, it is evident why so many people treasure this special town. Jupiter is full of places to eat, drink and have fun, with or without a family. As full of restaurants as Jupiter is, it takes a true local to know which places are the very best.
