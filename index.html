  <body>
    Home to many professional golfers and retirees, Jupiter, Florida is a small beach town just north of West Palm Beach. Getting off I-95 onto Indiantown Road --- Jupiter may not seem to be anything special, but once you reach the beach, it is evident why so many people treasure this special town. Jupiter is full of places to eat, drink and have fun, with or without a family. As full of restaurants as Jupiter is, it takes a true local to know which places are the very best.
<br>
<h2>Where to Eat</h2>
Jupiter is full of delicious restaurants with amazing views and amazing atmospheres.
<br><br>
<h3>Stop 1.</h3> Guanabanas - <i>Great atmosphere and fun nightlife</i>
<br><br>

<br><br>
Guanabanas is a must visit location when traveling to Jupiter. The restaurant is right on the water and offers an atmosphere unlike anywhere else. Although the wait can be long, it is an absolute must visit. The restaurant is family friendly during the day but turns into a bar atmosphere at night, especially on Wednesdays and Fridays when there is live music. Beyond the atmosphere, the food is delicious. Fish specials change daily and are caught by local fishermen that morning. If you are short on time and don’t want to risk a long wait, visit Guanabanas for Happy Hour happening each day from 3-6 p.m. or for breakfast on Saturday or Sunday.
<br><br>
<b>Our recommendations:</b> Lunch/dinner: fresh fish (especially golden tile fish), empanadas, black beans and rice. Breakfast: citrus french toast. Drink: Category 5.

<h3>Stop 2.</h3> U-Tiki - <i>Beautiful waterfront restaurant with great sea food and sushi</i>
<br><br>

<br>
Another must visit stop in Jupiter is the restaurant U-Tiki. U-Tiki is right across the road from Guanabanas, but offers a completely different scenic experience. From U-Tiki’s outside tables there is a stunning view of the town’s beautiful Lighthouse. U-Tiki serves fresh seafood and sushi that is always delicious. Although U-Tiki, like Guanabanas, can have a long wait, there are tables to wait at by the water with limited food service and plenty of bar seating.
<br><br>
<b>Our recommendations:</b> Lunch/dinner: spicy ahi tuna roll, bbq shrimp flatbread, sweet potato crusted hogfish (dinner only). Drink: Gulfstream Margarita.

<br>
If you’re looking for a place with generous helpings and a casual fun family atmosphere, Dune Dog is the place to visit.  Although the small, colorful restaurant may not seem like much, there is a reason why most locals are regulars. The restaurant sits right off A1A and is an open-air café. The menu ranges from their famous hot dogs to dolphin and crab cakes. No matter what plate you choose, expect a large serving of incredible food for a reasonable price. Do not be fooled by a crowd waiting outside, service is quick and the wait is usually short and so worth it.

<br><br>
<h3>Stop 4.</h3> Koon Manee - <i>Local favorite sushi restaurant</i>
<br><br>
This delicious sushi spot is fairly new to Jupiter and has grown quickly in popularity. Because of its location in a shopping strip, it is easy to miss. Locals frequently visit Koon Manee on their lunch break for a quick bite or for a casual dinner. The restaurant offers delicious sushi that cannot be beat anywhere else. Lunch at Koon Manee is a must-have because of the plethora of lunch bento boxes the restaurant offers.
<br><br>
<b>Our recommendations:</b> Lunch/dinner: chicken pad thai, sushi boat, cashew nut chicken.

<h3>Stop 5.</h3> C.R. Chicks - <i>Easy take-out with great flavors</i>
<br><br>
Unlike the other restaurants mentioned, C.R. Chicks is a great restaurant to stop at to get some great take-out after a long day at the beach. If take-out isn’t your ideal choice, there are limited dining tables, but you may have to wait for a seat. From the outside, it is obvious what C.R. Chicks specializes in. In the front window, rotisserie chickens are visible being cooked in the oven, and they always look absolutely delicious. C.R. Chicks not only serves delicious food but it’s always entertaining to hear the restaurant workers using their own “diner” language. C.R. Chicks is a local go-to on a busy night, after a long day of work, or any day you’re looking for a great meal.
<br><br>
<b>Our recommendations:</b> Lunch/dinner: rotisserie chicken, penne pasta with tomato sauce with romano cheese (a fan favorite known by locals as a “Smokey”), chicken pot pie, mashed potatoes, fresh bread (a must get!)

<h2>Activities to do in Jupiter</h2>
<h3>Stop 1.</h3> The beach - <i>of course</i>
<br><br>
It is impossible to visit Jupiter without spending time at the beach. Along the 5 miles of public beach access, there are a series of boardwalks about every tenth of a mile so you can make it to the beach without having to walk too far. Whether you want a more open stretch of beach, a spot closer to the pier, a spot with a lifeguard or a spot to watch surfers or wind surfers, there is a perfect spot for everyone. Parking at the beach can be hard to find during the summer and on weekends, but a large parking lot across the street from the pier offers overflow parking spots.
<br><br>

<h3>Stop 2.</h3> The lighthouse - <i>A great family activity</i>
<br><br>
The lighthouse is one of Jupiter’s favorite landmarks. Tours up the lighthouse are given every half hour every day of the week. Traveling to the top of the lighthouse offers you incredible views of every angle of Jupiter; on a pretty day the views of the blue water of the ocean and Intercoastal are unbeatable. Taking this tour is a great activity for visitors with families or locals who just want to see their home from a different angle. There is also an educational opportunity at the end of the tour where you can walk through a historic home that used to be lived in by members of the coast guard.

<h3>Stop 3.</h3> Loggerhead Marinelife Center - <i>A really fun experience for kids and animal lovers</i>
<br><br>
Loggerhead Marinlife Center is a sea-turtle rehabilitation center. The center rescues sea turtles that may have been hit by a boat propeller, cut or hurt by debris in the ocean or just got sick on their own. The center’s team of employees and volunteers provides food and medicine to the turtles while also providing information about the turtles to guests. Windows in the tank offer guests a close up view of the turtles, and if you come at the right time of the year (late spring, early summer), you may even get to see some rescued hatchlings. Aside from the turtle tanks in the back of the center, there is also an educational room inside the main building full of turtle facts and fish tanks with exotic fish like the lionfish.
